The variables are annual production-based emissions of carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) from cement, coal, flaring, gas, and oil. All variables are measured in million tonnes and are based on territorial emissions, which do not account for emissions embedded in traded goods. Beyond this, the interactive map also allows users to toggle between the data for certain years. This is important because we can compare data over time. Then, we can use our conclusions to understand the data better and make predictions for the future in hopes of creating a positive impact."))
